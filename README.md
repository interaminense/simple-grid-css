# Simple Grid Css

Simple Grid Css is a responsive grid system based on flexbox css

Another grid in css, however, this grid is much leaner! Great for building layouts just by being small and doing what I need: Building responsive layouts, just this.

## Getting started

1. Download compiled.zip from the latest release;
2. Extract the ZIP archive and locate the simple-grid-css.min.css or simple-grid-css.css files;

2. You will then find the source code in `node_modules/simple-grid-css/simple-grid-css.css`;
